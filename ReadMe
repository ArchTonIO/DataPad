The dataPad is a USB device, it uses a Raspberry pi Pico microcontroller,
a 1 inch 128x64 oled screen, an analog joystick, 21 buttons corresponding
to 21 addressable RGB leds for feedback. It can be used to control any
kind of software.
In this case I use it to easily work with Rhino3D for 3D modeling,
the "driver" (serial communication between the device and the PC) is 
created using Python3 and can be found in the Driver directory.
The .stl files for 3D printing will  be added soon with the schematic
to an hardware-dedicated directory.
